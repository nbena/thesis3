# My thesis

Each directory is a chpater, excluding of course `img` and `.vscode`.

The `Makefile` works fully on Linux, but it should (only) compile well on Windows too by specifying another LaTeX compiler.

You can build it running:

```bash
make build
```

The bibliography is currently in a raw LaTeX format but I already have written a tool to convert it.
